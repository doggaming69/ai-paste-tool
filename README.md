# ai-paste-tool
lets you paste ai without teacher knowing (obv if its not humanized gonna get detected but this is purely for pasting)
the tool also works in tests due to the simulated typo fixing and if you run as admin it blocks inputs from your own keystrokes letting you pretend to type
f1 start/pause
